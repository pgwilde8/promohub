## ⏰ **Automated Scheduling**

Your system runs automatically:

### **Daily Schedule**:
- **9:00 AM**: Conservative discovery (business + education, 30 creators)
- **4:00 PM**: Conservative discovery (technology + fitness, 24 creators)  
- **Every 30 min**: Hunter.io enrichment of discovered domains

### **Expected Daily Results**:
- **~54 creators discovered** (high-value niches)
- **~200 API requests used** (0.67% of total capacity)
- **~25-35 business domains** added to enrichment
- **~15-25 verified emails** from Hunter.io

## 🎯 **Production Workflows**

### **Week 1: Conservative Setup**
```bash
# Day 1: Test targeted discovery
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/targeted/business?max_creators=10"

# Wait 1 hour, check results
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/stats"

# If successful, let automation run
# Check results daily at 5 PM
```

### **Week 2: Scale Up**
```bash
# Monday: Aggressive discovery for research
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/aggressive"

# Rest of week: Let conservative automation run
# Friday: Check weekly stats
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/stats"
```

### **Month 1: Optimization**
```bash
# Focus on highest-converting niches based on results
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/targeted/business?max_creators=100"

# Check enrichment success rates
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/enrichment/stats"
```

## 📈 **Quota Management Strategy**

### **Daily Capacity (30,000 requests)**:

#### **Conservative Approach** (2% daily usage):
- **200 requests/day** for discovery
- **~29,800 requests remaining** for scaling/experiments
- **Sustainable for 150 days** without hitting quota

#### **Balanced Approach** (10% daily usage):  
- **1,000 requests/day** for discovery (5x more creators)
- **~29,000 requests remaining** for scaling
- **High-volume sustainable discovery**

#### **Aggressive Approach** (50% daily usage):
- **15,000 requests/day** for discovery
- **~2,000-3,000 creators/day** discovered
- **Enterprise-scale lead generation**

## 🎮 **Gaming vs Business Focus**

### **Business/Education Creators** (Recommended):
```bash
# Higher conversion rates, more likely to have business websites
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/targeted/business?max_creators=50"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/targeted/education?max_creators=50"

# Expected: 60-80% domain discovery rate
# Hunter.io success: 30-50% verified emails
```

### **Gaming/Creative Creators**:
```bash  
# Lower business domain rates, but higher audience engagement
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/targeted/gaming?max_creators=100"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/targeted/creative?max_creators=100"

# Expected: 20-40% domain discovery rate  
# Hunter.io success: 15-30% verified emails
```

## 🔄 **Best Practices**

### **Daily Routine**:
1. **Morning (9 AM)**: Check overnight automation results
2. **Afternoon**: Manual targeted discovery if needed
3. **Evening (5 PM)**: Review daily stats and plan tomorrow

### **Weekly Routine**:
1. **Monday**: Plan week's discovery strategy
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week aggressive discovery (if quota allows)
3. **Friday**: Review week's results and optimize

### **Monthly Routine**:
1. **Analyze conversion rates** by niche
2. **Optimize niche targeting** based on results  
3. **Scale successful patterns**

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **No Results Found**:
```bash
# Check quota status
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/debug"

# If quota exceeded, wait for reset (midnight Pacific Time)
# If API keys working, try different niche
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/targeted/education?max_creators=5"
```

### **Low Domain Discovery**:
```bash
# Focus on business-oriented niches
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/targeted/business?max_creators=25"

# Avoid pure entertainment niches for business leads
# gaming, creative = entertainment (lower business domain rates)
# business, education, technology = professional (higher rates)
```

### **Quota Management**:
```bash
# Check current usage estimates
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/quota-usage"

# Use conservative discovery during quota concerns
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/conservative"
```

# Day 2-7: Let automation run, check results daily
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/scraper/youtube/stats"

# End of week: Scale based on success
